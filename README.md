Looking for volunteering opportunities which allow me to utilise my skills for good, with a particular interest in secondary school projects/initiatives (having worked at a girls secondary school (and from a multi-generational family of educators - my mother is a retired secondary school science teacher, her mother was a maths teacher) I'm especially interested in working with KS3 female students, before their GCSE options are set in stone. 

Uptake of computer science GCSE is still markedly lower than uptake by male students, and the numbers are still falling: 'The number of girls in England studying for a GCSE in computing has more than halved in less than a decade' - source-  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/27/number-of-girls-in-england-taking-computing-gcse-plummets-study-finds#:~:text=In%202015%2043%25%20of%20candidates,18%2C600%20females%20took%20computer%20science.
