&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üåü&nbsp;Software Engineer | Software Analyst | Technical Consultant | MBCS  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üë©‚Äçüíª&nbsp;Versatile individual, a self starter with an aptitude for learning, a passion for problem-solving and an interest in development and data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ûï&nbsp;While I greatly enjoy coding, I'm also something of a bit of a maths geek who loves data (I undertook some additional data engineering training in 2023, which I hugely enjoyed). Therefore, some of my focus will be on building a data portfolio and completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, DataCamp Data Analyst certificate, and DataCamp Data Engineer Certificate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;üß†üß†&nbsp; Looking to get involved in DEI initiatives/projects (with a particular interest in mental health and neurodivergence).

## Personal goals (1- 2 years):

* Improve knowledge of architecture and design patterns, system design, systems thinking, networking, security

  
* **Obtain the following:**
* AWS Cloud practitioner certification
* DataCamp Data Engineer Associate Certification
* Data Analyst Associate Certification
* AWS Certified Developer Associate certification
* CompTIA Security+
* Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals

  
* **Work on the following:**
* Personal Angular and .Net applications which make use of many of my skills e.g. data pipelines, data visualization, microservices, AI, machine learning pipelines, AWS
* Contribute to Open Source

## Education:

**Makers Academy**
* 16 weeks extremely intensive coding bootcamp aimed at individuals from non-tech backgrounds. Many grads have non-STEM degrees and have gone on to achieve great success in their careers in development (and beyond).
* OOP, MVC, OOD, 
* Ruby, Rails
* JavaScript
* Testing with RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara
* Git 
* SQL
* EQ and growth mindset, meditation - run by the wonderful Chief Joy Officer at Makers (Dana Svoboda). Having a growth mindset is KEY in tech and especially in development.
* Heavily project-based work (during the week and weekends). Hands-on learning is the best way to learn to code.
* Post graduation, acted as a mentor to several students who were in the process of going through the bootcamp.

**FDM**
